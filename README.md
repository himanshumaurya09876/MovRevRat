<li>A ML and DL based project that classifies the reviews of a movie as positive or negative and can also predict rating of the movie based on the reviews.</li>
<li>Used NLTK (most powerful library for NLP) to preprocess the movie rewiews.</li>
<li>Performed Tokenization, Stopwords removal and Stemming in preprocessing the reviews.</li>
<li>Used Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.</li>
<li>Plotted Confusion Matrix to compare these models and then reported the best model with highest accuracy and used the same to predict rating of the movie.</li>
